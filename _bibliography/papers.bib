  abstract = {The Time Domain Passivity Approach (TDPA) has been ac
cepted as one of least conservative tools for designing stabilizing controllers
in haptics and teleoperation, but it still suffers from conservatism because
it is based on passivity. Additionally, high-frequency, immediate control
actions lead to a degradation of transparency. In this paper, we propose
a method to relax the conservatism of haptic interaction and enhance
stable impedance range while maintaining high transparency. Based on the
observation of energy exchange behavior in pressing and releasing paths
in haptic interaction, we introduce an energy cycle as a completion of a
pressing and releasing path. With this new concept, we compare the energies
at the end of each energy cycle to estimate the energy generation and inject
adaptive damping to regulate it over upcoming cycles. Because we wait
a pressing-releasing cycle is completed, we allow energy to be generated,
but we regulate the amount of generated energy over upcoming cycles
by injecting adaptive damping. In this way, we perform low-frequency
control actions on system dynamics. These in turn enable us to achieve
high transparency. We show the validity of the proposed approach through
several simulations and experiments, and show that it enhances the stable
impedance range and transparency compared to the TDPA.}

  title={Model-Free Energy-Based Friction Compensation for Industrial Collaborative Robots as Haptic Displays},
  author={Dinc, Huseyin Tugcan and Lee, Joong-Ku and Ryu, Jee-Hwan},
  journal={IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics},
  year={2024},
  publisher={IEEE},
  abstract = {Collaborative robots are a promising alterna-
tive to traditional haptic displays due to their expansive
workspaces, ability to generate substantial forces, and
cost-effectiveness. However, they have higher levels of fric
tion compared to conventional haptic displays, which nega
tively impact the precise movement and accuracy of haptic
feedback, potentially causing operator fatigue. This article
proposes a novel model-free, energy-based approach for
estimating and compensating the friction coefficient. Our
approach calculates the time-varying impact of frictional
forces during an energy cycle, defined as the period be-
tween two consecutive zero crossings of the systemâ€™s ki-
netic energy, based on the energy dissipated by friction.
This approach directly estimates the friction coefficients,
based on the chosen friction model, without requiring any
prior system model information or tuning parameters. The
effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through
single and multi-degree-of-freedom human interaction ex-
periments using a Franka Emika Panda robot. The results
indicate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-
the-art friction compensation methods.}

  abstract = {The present paper proposes a novel strategy to enhance admittance-type haptic interaction using bidirectional time-domain passivity control. While admittance-type haptic interaction is widely employed in human-robot collaboration, its ability to render low virtual inertia can be limited, leading to unstable interactions with rigid environments. The proposed strategy seeks to stabilize a lower range of virtual inertia while maintaining responsive behavior in free space. The Franka Emika Collaborative robot was utilized in various experiments to test the approach, and the results indicate that the bidirectional time-domain passivity controller can improve interaction performance relative to the conventional unidirectional time-domain passivity approach. This technique may aid in reducing operator fatigue during the manipulation of heavy, non-back drivable industrial robots while preserving a lightweight feel.}
