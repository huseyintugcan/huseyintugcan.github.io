I received my **B.Sc. in Mechatronics Engineering** as well as **Electronics Engineering** from [Erciyes University](https://www.erciyes.edu.tr) in 2016, and **M.Eng. in Mechatronics and Cyber Physical Systems** from [Deggendorf Institute of Technology](https://www.th-deg.de/en) in 2020. I conducted my master's thesis in [German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics](https://www.dlr.de/en/rm) under the supervision of [Thomas Hulin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tneD2FcAAAAJ&hl=de). I got my **Ph.D. in Robotics** from [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) in 2025 under the supervision of [Jee-Hwan Ryu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zLOoWCUAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=ao).

## Research Interests 

My research interests include **physical-human robot interaction (phri)**, focused on **haptics** and **bilateral teleoperation**. During my Ph.D., I developed an **energy-based control** approach for **phri**. This approach relaxes conventional **passivity condition** while ensuring system **stability** and maintaining **transparency**. In my postdoctoral career, utilizing my experience in **control theory**, I would like to explore interconnections between [control theory and machine learning](https://sites.google.com/view/control-meets-learning/home), and develop **safe and explainable learning strategies** that ensure reliability, particularly **safety-critical** applications.xw
